# ReviewBG

Hosted app: https://reviewbg.netlify.app/

## Introduction

ReviewBG is a basic CRUD (created, read, update, delete) app made with React. It is based on board game reviews, and allows users to vote for and comment on their favourite reviews. Users can also delete their own comments.

The app doesn't currently support password log-ins, but users can select their preferred profile from a drop-down menu in the header.

It is built on a RESTful API made using Node.js and Express. The API makes requests to a PSQL database.
